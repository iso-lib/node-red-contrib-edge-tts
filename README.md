# node-red-contrib-edge-tts

A Node-RED node that converts text to speech using Microsoft Edge's Text-to-Speech service. This node provides a simple way to integrate Azure Speech Service capabilities into your Node-RED flows without requiring an Azure account or API key.

## Overview

This node uses the Microsoft Edge Read Aloud API to generate high-quality speech from text. It supports a wide range of voices across multiple languages and dialects, with customizable speech parameters such as rate, pitch, and volume.

### Input

The node accepts the following input properties:

- `msg.payload` (string): Text to convert to speech (if `msg.text` is not provided)
- `msg.text` (string): Text to convert to speech (takes precedence over payload)
- `msg.filename` (string): Path to save the audio file (default: `tts_[timestamp].mp3`)
- `msg.voice` (string): Voice to use for speech synthesis
- `msg.rate` (number): Speech rate adjustment (-100 to 100)
- `msg.pitch` (number): Speech pitch adjustment in Hz
- `msg.volume` (number): Speech volume (0-100)
- `msg.format` (string): Audio output format
- `msg.agent` (string): SOCKS proxy URL (if needed)
- `msg.voiceLocale` (string): Voice locale
- `msg.sentenceBoundary` (boolean): Enable sentence boundary markers
- `msg.wordBoundary` (boolean): Enable word boundary markers

### Output

The node outputs a message with the following properties:

- `msg.result`: Buffer containing the audio data
- `msg.filename`: Path to the saved audio file
